# Hardware
This project involves creating a digital circuit setup that utilizes various components to generate random numbers displayed on a seven-segment display. Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown of the project:

    Power Supply Setup: A breadboard is powered using a USB-to-micro-USB board to supply +5V VCC and ground connections.

    Clock Generation with 555 Timer: A 555 timer circuit generates a square pulse clock signal using capacitors and resistors.

    Binary to Decimal Conversion: A circuit includes a 7447 decoder to convert binary inputs into specific output patterns and a 7486 XOR gate alongside two 7474 D flip-flops to store single-bit information.

    Clock Integration: The output clock signal from the 555 timer circuit is connected to the clock input of the D flip-flops.

    Seven-Segment Display Integration: Connections are made between the seven-segment display and the decoder. This display can show numerical digits (0-9) and additional characters.

Observations

During operation, the seven-segment display exhibits random numbers and additional characters as generated by the circuit. This demonstrates the practical application of shift registers and other digital components in generating and displaying random variables using electronic circuits.
